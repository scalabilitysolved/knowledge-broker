Your team's knowledge is scattered across repos, wikis, Confluence, and Slack. Traditional search finds documents. Knowledge Broker finds answers, tells you how much to trust them, and shows you where sources disagree.

AI agents query it over MCP, people use the CLI, and teams get a shared HTTP API. Hybrid search, structured confidence signals, and contradiction detection. Open-source and self-hosted - no data leaves your environment.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://knowledgebroker.dev/install.sh | sh
```

Or build from source (requires Go 1.24+):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alecgard/knowledge-broker.git
cd knowledge-broker
make install
```

Ollama is installed and configured automatically on first run.

## Ingest

```bash
kb ingest --source ./my-repo --description "Backend API"
kb ingest --git https://github.com/acme/platform --description "Platform services"
kb ingest --confluence ENGINEERING --description "Engineering wiki"
kb ingest --slack C0ABC123DEF --description "Platform engineering channel"
```

## Query

```bash
# Raw retrieval — no API key needed
kb query --raw "What database does the inventory service use?"

# Synthesised answer (requires an LLM provider — Claude by default)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
kb query "What database does the inventory service use?"
```

```jsonc
{
  "answer": "The inventory service uses PostgreSQL (v16 on RDS, r6g.2xlarge).",
  "confidence": {
    "overall": 0.93,
    "breakdown": {
      "freshness": 0.94,
      "corroboration": 0.85,
      "consistency": 1.00,
      "authority": 0.95
    }
  },
  "sources": [
    { "source_type": "confluence", "source_name": "ENGINEERING", "source_path": "Internal Services" },
    { "source_type": "slack", "source_name": "engineering", "source_path": "#platform-engineering/2026-03-06" }
  ],
  "contradictions": []
}
```

## Local Mode

Not everyone has a Claude or OpenAI API key. Local mode synthesises answers using a small model running entirely on your machine via Ollama — no data leaves your environment, no API costs, no setup beyond a single env var.

```bash
export KB_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
kb query "How does the payment retry logic work?"
```

The model is pulled automatically on first run. In the web UI, click **Local** to switch modes. Answers stream back with inline source citations and the same confidence signals as every other mode.

Best for: quick lookups, onboarding onto a new codebase, and environments where external API calls aren't an option.

## Serve

```bash
kb serve # HTTP API on :8080, MCP on :8082 (stdio + SSE)
```
